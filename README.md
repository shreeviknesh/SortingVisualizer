Bubble Sort
----
- Bubble sort is one the simplest sorting algorithms that goes through the whole array and swaps adjacent elements if they're in the wrong order.
- The worst-case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n<sup>2</sup>) even if the array is sorted.
- Optimization:
  - The algorithm can be optimized to stop if the inner loop does not cause any swaps, i.e., the array is sorted.
  - This leads to the best-case time complexity of O(n) and average-case time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
